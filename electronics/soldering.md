[HOW TO SOLDER! (Beginner's Guide)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jAw41LRBxU)

## Solder
Derives from Latin "solidare" - to make solid.

A metal alloy capable of being fused at relatively low temperatures. Solder melts and wets the joints that are to be fused to. They have lower melting points than the joints to be joined to. Solder should be resistent to oxidative and corrosive effects that degrade joints.

Soft solder melting point of 90-450c. 180-190c are the most commonly used. Above 450deg is called "hard soldering". Eutectic solder, such as the classic alloy of 63/37 tin:lead, has lower melting points than its individual components & coincidences with its freezing temp - i.e. no slush or in between state, mostly discrete liquid & solid states.

## Basic steps
1. "Tin" the tip, by rubbing it on a wet sponge or brass filings.
2. Coat tip in solder & wipe it off again (the flux removes oxidised layer, excess solder pulls away junk too)
3. Add small amount of solder to iron (why?) and ensure all surfaces that you are joining are hot enough to melt the solder.
4. Melt solder & when melted and sitting in place, pull away soldering iron.

Reflow = do it again

## Flux
What is flux?

Flux core solder is the most common type of solder. Inside the metal alloy is a flux core.

If we accidentally bridge two joints together, we can use this to attract the solder from joints back to the wick. Flux + wire does the same.

Flux does remain on the electronics after using it. Flux is a type of acid, eats away at joints if left on. Isopropyl alcohol can be used to clean it off - ensuring that the electronics are not powered! Spray, scrub & dry. You can also buy flux-off.
