# LaTeX
This comes up a lot and I can only ever copy paste so here we go.

A software system for typesetting documents, from 1984. Based on TeX, from 1978, by Donald Knuth. Refers to engines, macros, packages. A popular means of typesetting complex mathematical formulae. Donald Knuth wrote the Art of Computer Programming, was pissed about the typesetting so built a computational system to typeset.

LaTeX is a higher level system of macros etc using TeX primitives.

Typst is a modern, but young alternative. For now I'm going to stick with LaTeX.

## Main production engines
- pdfTeX
- XeTeX
- LuaTeX

## Distribution & TeX pkg management
- TeX Live
- MiKTeX

## Web rendering
- MathJax
- KATEX

## LaTeX editors I've personally tried:
- Zed + TeXpresso = https://github.com/lnay/zed-texpresso?tab=readme-ov-file - right idea, but awful (brings up the world's worst PDF viewer in a floating window)
- Ok fuck it I get it, either nvim + vimtex or overleaf. Everything in between fkn sucks. Actually upmath.me wasn't bad for a web-based one.

## Markdown with LaTeX snippet support
- Typora (electron): Despicable slow to render snippets, no split view, very bad UI
